# Bookstore

In this project, I built a a website for a bookshop using React and Redux.

The purpose of this project was to practice and demonstrate my ability to create React components which are all connected to a single source of 'state': the Redux store object. In this particular project, the store contains information about the bookshop's current list of books, and also contains information about the category filter that is currently selected.
